<h2>⚙️ How It Works</h2>

<p>
This extension connects directly to the <strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash API</strong> from Google’s Generative Language platform. When you type a question into the chatbot window:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The question and answer options are formatted as a prompt.</li>
  <li>This prompt is sent to Gemini via a secure API request.</li>
  <li>Gemini processes the prompt and identifies the correct option.</li>
  <li>The extension receives the response and displays only the correct answer (e.g., <code>B</code>) without any explanation or reasoning.</li>
</ol>

<p>
All this happens behind the scenes within seconds, ensuring a smooth and fast experience without needing to open a new tab or search manually.
